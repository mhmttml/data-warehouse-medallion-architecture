# ðŸ§  Data Management Approach

For this project, Weâ€™ve chosen the Data Warehouse approach to manage and organize data from ERP and CRM systems. A Data Warehouse provides a structured, reliable, and performance-optimized environment for analytics and reporting.

To design the warehouse, weâ€™ve implemented the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into three layers:

- Bronze â€“ Raw data ingestion

- Silver â€“ Cleaned and transformed data

- Gold â€“ Business-level, aggregated data for analytics

- This layered approach ensures data quality, scalability, and modularity in the ETL pipeline.
